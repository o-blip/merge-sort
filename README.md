# merge-sort
This is from the Odin Project, the Recusion Project

"Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
  1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
  2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list."
